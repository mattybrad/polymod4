# PolyMod 4

A polyphonic digital synthesizer which can be patched like an analog modular synth.

Current setup is C++ code running on an Electrosmith Daisy board (with built-in DAC), on a PCB which includes potentiometers, buttons, LEDs, and circuitry to detect connections between output and input sockets.
