Have now got a working system, in mono at least.
A few next steps:
    Tidy up the source code, making it nicer to define sockets/modules
    Also make pot definitions part of same slickening process
    Centralise sample rate, don't just hardcode 48000 each time
    Add logical pin ordering (0 at top, 31 at bottom)
    Optimise delays - system tick stuff is blocking? and delayMS is too coarse
    Smooth analog controls (sounds too "steppy")
    Add LFO module to help test filters etc
    Add polyphony (!!!)
    Add RPS module
    Add CPU monitoring
    Stress-test the code
