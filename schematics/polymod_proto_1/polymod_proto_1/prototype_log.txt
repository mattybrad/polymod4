Issues found with PCB/case so far:
- Didn't leave enough room for 3.5mm/PSU jacks (has to remove part of PCB with drill/cutters)
- Forgot to add pull-up resistors to buttons
- Pots too close together for most knobs
- Top panel screws (to secure panel to PCB) are wrong size (much too big)
- Should have used AGND/3V3_A for pots
